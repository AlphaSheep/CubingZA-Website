        <i>Cubing South Africa</i> (<b>CubingZA</b>) was formed to support and promote cubing and speedcubing in South Africa.

        South African speedcubers first started getting together in 2012, and the first unofficial competition had
        just 3 competitors. Today, more 500 South Africans have recorded times in official competitions.
